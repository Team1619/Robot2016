 * This the the subclass of UGenericLogger which is meant to log numerical data in a
 * comma-separated-value format. This can then be easily displayed or analyzed.
 *
 * All columns have headers, and all rows have a single unique time stamp at which all
 * of the data in that row was recorded.
 *
 * This is meant to be used for values from the Power Distribution Panel, like voltage
 * and current draw values for all motors.
